# SJTU-School of Cyber Science-UG programming homework reference

### Repo introduction

This is a repo to collect my own homework of  Shanghai Jiao Tong university - Cyber Science School. The purpose of this repo is to provide some references for later students so that they can get started quickly and write better codes. I hope you can also actively submit your own idea to [this Project](https://github.com/SJTU-SCS/awesome-scs). 

PS: There may be anti-cheat Check in our Department. **Note that: I believe some good code can help you get started quickly, but I sincerely hope you can keep away from being a copycat!**

### For questions

1. find some mistakes here; 
2. or feel confused about my code;
3. or just wanna to get some details about my idea.

You can ping me at [mkxu@foxmail.com](mailto:mkxu@foxmail.com). **Discussion is always welcomed!**
